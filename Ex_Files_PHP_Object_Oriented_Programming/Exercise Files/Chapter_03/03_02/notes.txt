Define a Subclass

class Parent {
}

class Subclass extends Parent {
}


class Document {
    var $file_name;

    function download_path() {
        return "/downloads/" . $this->file_name;
    }
}
class ProductBrochure extends Document {
}
class WarrantyDocument extends Document {
}
class CleaningInstructions extends Document {
}

subclasses can have additional subclasses:

class Vehicle {
    var $wheels;
    var $doors;

    function gasoline_type() {
        return 'Unleaded';
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
}
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
}
class CompactCar extends Car {
}

Vehicle (parent)
Car and Motorcycle (subclasses)
Car -> CompactCar (Subclass)

Functions for Inheritance

get_parent_class($mixed)
    can either take the name of the class or an instance of the class as an argument

is_subclass_of($mixed, $string)
    can also take the name of a class or an instance as its first argument

class_parents($mixed)
    to find out if something is a subclass of whatever that parent class might be, or ask for all class parents
