Instance: A single occurance of something

Instance (OOP): A single object created from a class definition

To create an instnace we first need a class definition

class Person {

}

The way we create the instance of the class is by using the new keyword
followed by the class name (this is called instantiation)

$person1 = new Person;

Creating a new object is almost always done while also assigning that object
to a variable here we're assigning it to the variable person 1

We can create a second instance of the class and assign it to a different
variable person 2. We can have as many instances as we want. Each one will 
be a unique object, but all of them will share the same class definition.

$person2 = new Person;

Functions for Instances

get_class($object)
    takes an instance as its argument and it returns the name of that class

is_a($object, $string)
    takes an object and a string as arguments and it returns true or false
    if the object has the same class name as the string
