Class Methods
-Functions to perform object actions
-Non-OOp: "functions"; OOP: "methods"
-Define inside classes like regular functions

class Person {
    var $first_name;
    var $last_name;

    function say_hello() {
        return "Hello world!";
    }
}

$customer = new Person;

$customer->first_name = 'Anna';
echo $customer->first_name;
// Anna

echo $customer->say_hello();
//Hello world!

-When working with properties before we used property name with arrow 
notation and the property name. 
-Use arrow notation to refer to the method name. There are parentheses
after method name.
-If there is a notation and it's followed by parentheses, it's a call 
to a method. If there are no parentheses it's a call to a property.

Functions for Methods

get_class_methods($mixed)
    takes either a class name as a string or an instance of an object
    and returns the different methods that are available on it

method_exists($mixed, $string)
    you pass in either the class name as a string or an instance as
    the first argument and then the second argument would be the method
    that you want to know if it exists or not
