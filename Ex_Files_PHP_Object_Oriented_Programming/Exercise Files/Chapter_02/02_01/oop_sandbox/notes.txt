Best Practices
-Capitalize and camelcase class names
-Make nouns singular
-Define each class in a separate file
-Group class files in a directory

Functions for Classes
get_declared_classes()
    will return an array of classes that php knows about
class_exists($string)
    takes a string as an argument and returns true or false
    depending on whether a class is in that array of declared classes
