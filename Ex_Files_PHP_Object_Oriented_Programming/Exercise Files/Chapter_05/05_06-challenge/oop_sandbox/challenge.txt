Challenge: Static References
- Reuse Bicycle and Unicycle classes
- challenge_04.php
- add a static property $instance_count
- write a static method create()
    - add one to $instance_count
    - create and return a new instance of the class
- Set visibility modifiers on $instance_count and create() 

- Define a constant for storing an array of categories
- Road, Mountain, Hybrid, Cruiser, City, BMX
- For PHP 7.1+, set visibility modifier to public
- Add a $category property for instances to store their category

- Make $wheels a static property
- Make wheel_details() a static method
- Ensure that Unicycle returns expected wheel_details()

Extra Credit
- Create a method in Unicycle which extends a method in Bicycle by executing code before and/or after it 
- Create a method in Unicycle which overrides a method in Bicycle but then also falls back to the original method if a condition is not met
