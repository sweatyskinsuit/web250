Watch the entire Object Access Control tutorial (chapter 4). Use the
challenge-03-oac.php file. You must address all of Kevin's points.
Add visibility modifiers to the bicycle class
Set visibility for all existing properties and methods. Deciding what to make public,
protected, and private is difficult. To give yourself some help, check out the answer for
visibility, then try to do it yourself.
Create a unicycle subclass.
Add the property $wheels and set values for each class.
Define a wheelDetails() method which returns "it has two wheels" when called.
Make weightKg a private property.
Define a setWeightKg() method (setter method).
Create a getter method to read that value back followed by "kg."
Modify the weightLbs() method to add "lbs" to it.
What bug have you introduced to the $weightKg ?
Try doing as much of this as possible without peeking at the solution. It's an excellent exercise.

Challenge: Access Control
1:
- Add visibility modifiers to Bicycle class
- Challenge_03.php
- Set visibility for all existing properties and methods
2:
- Create Unicycle as a subclass of Bicycle
- Add property $wheels with default values for each class
- Set visibility such that $wheels is only available to the code that defines Bicycle and Unicycle
- Define a wheel_details() method which returns "It has 2 wheels" or "It has one wheel" when called on an instance
3:
- Make $weight_kg a private property 
- Define a set_weight_kg() method 
- Define a weight_kg() method which returns the weight followed by "kg"
- Modify the weight_lbs() method to add "lbs"
- What bug exists related to $weight_kg?
- How would you fix it?
