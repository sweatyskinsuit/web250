Magic Methods (Methods on php objects that get called automatically in some circumstances)
- __construct()
- __destruct()
- __clone()
- http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php
- __get(), __set()

The way to use a magic method is to define it as a method inside our class

class Product {

    public $name;
    public $color;

    public function __construct() {
        Logger::log('Creating new product');
        $this->color = 'blue';
    }
}

$shirt = new Product;
echo $shirt->color;
// blue

The two functions here do the same thing:
class Bicycle {
    public static $instance_count;

    public function __construct() {
        self::$instance_count++;
    }

    public static function create() {
        $obj = new static;
        self::$instance_count++;
        return $obj;
    }
}

Construct allows us to add this other work directly to the new call. And with construct, there's no need to return a value like we did in create. What's returned is always going to be an instance of an object. So when we call new in PHP, what's going on is the same thing is what our create method does. First, it creates a new instance of the called class. Second, it executes any custom code that we have in the construct method. And third, it returns the instance. So you can think of a construct method as a place to hold code that should be performed in step two. After an instance is created, but before it's returned.
