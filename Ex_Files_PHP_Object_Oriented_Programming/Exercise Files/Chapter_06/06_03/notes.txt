Destructor Method

class Product {
    public static $instance_count = 0;

    public function __construct() {
        Logger::log('Creating a product');
        self::$instance_count++;
    }

    public function __destruct() {
        Logger::log('Deleting a product');
        self::$instance_count--;
    }
}

- Destruct takes no arguments
- Best for logging and cleanup operations
Times destructor method is called
- Called when the last reference (the variable that we create that points to the new instance that we've created) to an instance is removed
- When unset() is called on an instance
- When script ends
